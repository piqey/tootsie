### the program that passes gas
An incredibly basic (thus far) Discord bot I am creating with the intention of expanding my knowledge regarding Python 3. Has no utility or general purpose other than to annoy or perhaps enterain anyone it interacts with.

I guess you can do whatever you want with this but it's not really meant for modification; I have the repository set to public for the ease of sharing my work with other individuals without the requirement of adding everyone as a collaborator.
