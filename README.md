# Tootsie
### the program that passes gas
An incredibly basic (thus far) Discord bot I am creating with the intention of expanding my knowledge regarding Python 3. Has no utility or general purpose other than to annoy or perhaps enterain anyone it interacts with.

I guess you can do whatever you want with this but it's not really meant for modification; I have the repository set to public for the ease of sharing my work with other individuals without the requirement of adding everyone as a collaborator.

To get this to work on your own Discord token, you'll need to make a `.env` file in the main directory (where `tootsie.py` is) and add to it `DISCORD_TOKEN=<your_discord_token>`. Other than that, if you don't already have FFmpeg installed, you will need to get it and add the directory containing it to your environment variables (PATH).
